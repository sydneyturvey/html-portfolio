<h1>The Best Movies According to Sydney</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pitch Perfect</h3>
<p>So iconic. The cup song was revolutionary.</p>
<h3>Don't Worry Darling</h3>
<p>
  This one had the whole theatre shook the entire time. Florence Pugh and Harry
  Styles have my heart. Also, watched this on the first date with my girfriend.
</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>Unmatched high movie.</p>
